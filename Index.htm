<h2>Now before we get started, LEARN THE NOTATIONS FROM THE BELOW IMAGE!!!</h2>
<img src="notation.png" alt="Rubikscube" width="400" height="210">
<p>Now that you have learned how to turn the cube with proper notations. I will teach you how to prepare a Rubik's Cube for speedcubing. Note that these steps are optional, but I highly recommend them. Often when you first purchase a Rubik's Cube, it can be difficult to turn. Preparing a Rubik's Cube using silicone spray will make it easier to turn and more enjoyable to solve. When you're ready, move on to Step 1 - Solving the Cross.</p>

<h2>Step-1 : Make a White Cross as shown in the image below</h2>

<h2>Step-2 : Solve the First Layer with the simple (R U R' U')Algorithm </h2>
<img src="136-1361200_first-layer-completed-rubiks-cube-first-layer-solved.png" alt="Rubikscube" width="210" height="150">
<p>This is the first step to solving the Rubik's Cube. In this step, we will solve the first four edges. This step is mostly intuitive, so the best way to get good at this step is to just practice. If you practice this step for a while, it will eventually just become second nature to you.</p>
<p>To place a corner where the white is facing the right side of the cube:
<>If white is facing the front of the cube, turn the face with the white on it first, move the corner into place, and restore the cross.</p>
<>If the white is on the bottom, first turn the right layer down so that the white will rotate to be on a side of the cube instead of the bottom, turn the bottom layer twice, and undo the right turn. You now have one of the above cases.</p>
<>And if the white is stuck in the top layer on the front face, turn the front face clockwise to bring the corner to the bottom layer, turn the bottom layer to move the piece away, and undo the front turn. You now have one of the first two cases.</p>
<>And if the white is stuck in the top layer on the right face, turn the right face down to bring the corner to the bottom layer, turn the piece away, and undo the first turn. You now have one of the first two cases.</p>

<h2>Step-3 : Solve the Second Layer with the below 2 Algorithms in the image </h2>
<img src="solution_step3.jpg" alt="Rubikscube" width="400" height="210">
<p>If the edge matches up with the color that is to the left of the two colors, you have this case. Since red is the left of the two colors, we move the top layer towards the left, right side up, top side counterclockwise, right side down, top side counterclockwise, rotate the cube towards the left, left side up, top side clockwise, and left side down.
If the edge matches up with the color that is to the right of the two colors, you have this case. Bring the right color to the front--in our case, this is green. Since green is the right of the two colors, we move the top layer towards the right, left side up, top side clockwise, left side down, top side clockwise, rotate the cube towards the right, right side up, top side counterclockwise, and right side down.
In this case (or if there is any other piece trapped in the middle layer), just put a dummy piece in place to force the trapped piece out and then place it properly.</p>

<h2>Step-4 : Solve the Last Layer Cross with the given Algorithm. Refer Image!!! </h2>
<img src="bigil.jpg" alt="Rubikscube" width="400" height="190">
<p>This is the goal of this step. If you already have the yellow cross, you can move on to the next step. This will happen 1 out of every 8 solves.
For this case, you have two solved edges opposite each other. If you ignore the corners, this case makes a straight line so I'll call it the "bar." To solve, turn the front layer clockwise, right side up, top side clockwise, right side down, top side counter clockwise, and front layer counterclockwise.
For this case, the solved edges must be at the front and right positions. This makes a small upside-down "L" so I'll call it the "L" case. The algorithm for this case is exactly the same as the "bar" case except you turn the front TWO layers instead of just the front one. That is, front two layers clockwise, right side up, top side clockwise, right side down, top side counter clockwise, front two layers counterclockwise.
This is just a combination of the first two cases. First, solve pretend you have the bar and perform the appropriate algorithm. Then, solve the "L" case.</p>

<h2>Step-5 : Orient the Last Layer with the below Algorithms </h2>
<img src="step6.jpg" alt="Rubikscube" width="360" height="190">
<p>Now the Orientation of the last layer is done, now we will go the the Final Step</p>

<h2>Step-5 : Finish the Cube or Happiness!!! </h2>
<img src="final.jpg" alt="Rubikscube" width="400" height="190">
<p>Now you might have to do the above algorithms twice or sometimes just once, but if you do the correct rotations you will solve your cube. </p>
