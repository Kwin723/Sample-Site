<h2> About My Cubing Journey</h2>
<p> I'm Kevin, i started cubing in 2012, when i was just 12 years old. First Cubing started as an accomplishment, Later it turned out to be more and more interesting than i ever thought i would be. I started practising more and more more... i teached my friends, i participated in some competitons and guess what?, now i can solve a 3X3 standard Rubiks Cube with an average time of 15 seconds! Impressive Ain't it, if you wanna learn solving the cube check our website for the beginners method, i will later on add more content and bring in more advanced algorithms and methods, such as the Fridrich method. I use the Fridrich method right now, which consists of four steps, the cross followed by first two layer together (f2l) followed by Oll which means orientation of last layer and PLL which means permutations of last layer.</p>


<h2>About Cubing History</h2>
<p> A History of cubing which includes Rubik's Cube and other related puzzles. Rubik's Cube was invented in 1974 by Ernő Rubik, a Hungarian designer and architect living and working in Budapest. Initially known as the "Magic Cube", production began in Hungary in late 1977 and small numbers of Cubes were reaching the hands of mathematicians in the West in 1978. In 1979 a major US toy company, Ideal, signed a licensing agreement and launched Rubik's Cube into international markets in 1980. It quickly became a huge craze, peaking in 1981, and only ending in late 1982. Numerous other puzzles appeared in its wake, including the 4×4×4 Rubik's Revenge, and Uwe Mèffert's Pyraminx. For a couple of years the Cube craze also spawned the sport of speedcubing, which included a World Championship in 1982. Interest in Rubik's Cube fell in 1983 and sales crashed everywhere. Rubik's Cubes began trickling back into the shops in the 1990s, and this created a second generation of speedcubers from around 1999 onwards. A second World Championship was held in 2003 and has been repeated every two years since. From 2007 Chinese versions of Rubik's Cube have seen improvements on the basic design, a process which has accelerated from 2011 onwards giving the world speedcubes which are engineered for speed. </p>
